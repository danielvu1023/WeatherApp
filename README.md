## Description

This basic application helps to display the current weather and 6 day weather forecast for any city provided by OpenWeatherâ€™s weather API. All that is needed is a city to be inputted into the search field and the type of weather information you would like to receive. Once submitted, the application will display a card with the city name, temperature, and date. If the forecast option is selected, then the temperature and date for the 6 day forecast will be available.
